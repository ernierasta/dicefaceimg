# About go-diceface

This is golang library designed to produce dice face images.
At the first stage it will generate D6 dice faces. Maybe I will other dices.

## Why?

It is used in tobytables project. I wanted to be able to have some textual 
representation of a dice in source and graphical dice with this value in the
output.
